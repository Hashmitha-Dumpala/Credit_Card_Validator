# Credit_Card_Validator

C++ was used to create this Credit Card Validator application. It uses the Luhn's algorithm to verify the credit card number and identify the type of credit card.

It uses the Luhn algorithm to determine whether a credit card number is legitimate or not. Luhn's method is a straightforward checksum formula that can be used to verify a variety of identifications, including credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, and more, although it is most commonly used to verify credit card numbers.

After entering the credit card number, the system verifies its validity and determines whether it is a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or another form of card. It verifies the authenticity of the card and the type of credit card by performing some basic operations and validations. Credit card numbers entered by the user are generated along with a message indicating whether the card is valid or invalid. If the credit card number entered is valid, the credit card type will also be printed.

There are patterns in credit card numbers.
Credit card number must contain 13 to 16 digits. It must start with 4 for Visa cards , 5 for Master cards ,  37 for American express, 6 for Discover.
